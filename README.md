# StrassenMultiplication

Instead of the traditional 8 matrix-matrix multiplications done by the divide and conquer technique, Strassen identified a method that reduces this to 7 multiplications. The overall runtime complexity of the na√Øve method is O(n^3) which is reduced to O(n^2.8074) using Strassen.
